# StakingPlatform Smart Contract

## Vision

The **StakingPlatform** smart contract enables users to participate in staking pools where they can stake tokens and earn rewards based on a reward rate. It provides a decentralized and transparent system for rewarding users for staking their assets, encouraging long-term participation.

## Features

- **Create Staking Pool**:
  - Pool owners can create a staking pool and set a reward rate per staked token.
- **Stake Tokens and Earn Rewards**:
  - Users can stake tokens into the pool and earn rewards proportional to the amount staked and the reward rate set by the pool owner.

## Future Scope

1. **Dynamic Reward Rates**:

   - Allow for dynamic reward rates that adjust based on pool performance or market conditions.

2. **Unstaking Functionality**:

   - Add an option for users to unstake their tokens and withdraw rewards after a locking period.

3. **Multi-Pool Support**:
   - Enable users to stake across multiple pools to diversify their rewards.

The **StakingPlatform** contract provides a decentralized solution for staking tokens and earning rewards, promoting user participation and incentivizing long-term staking.
